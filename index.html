                                Hi Mohamed, I hope this email finds you well!
                                It's been a while since we last caughtup, and
                                I've been thinking about our last conversation.
                                <br /><br />
                                How have you been? I'd love to reconnect and
                                hear about what's new in your world.
                                <br /><br />
                                How about grabbing a coffee sometime next week?
                                I'm flexible with my schedule, so let me know
                                when works for you. Looking forward to catching
                                up and hearing all about your latest adventures.
                                <br /><br />
                                Best,<br />
